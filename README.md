# CSNAKE

A small terminal game of C.

## Comment

I've written this twice before. The first was naive, complex and almost
resembled object-oriented, the second was almost unmaintainable, after looking
at it after only a week I was completely lost.

This is an attempt to rewrite CSnake into a decently small yet still logically
organised and maintainable code base.
